		API

 Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two 
 applications to interact with each other,
 helps two different softwareâ€™s to communicate and exchange data with each other.

Three types of WEB API

SOAP simple object access protocol
RPC  remote procedure call
REST  Representational state transfer 


Rest API is nothing but the Design Pattern for Web API

==========================================================================
API Testing 

Testing of API's is called as API testing, API testing is done on the business layer
( business logic is tested) API Testing is done without having the UI, here we only 
the test the Business Logic that is developed by developers,which is also called as API.
 We use Certain tools like POSTMAN for performing API testing.
