explain framework => 
our project building tool was MAVEN
we configured all dependencies in POM.xml file
 in our framwork we use POM as  a design pattern with data driven approach and so in which we had a testbase package in which
we had a base class in which we initialize the driver and read the propertiers file
then we had the page classs package in which we had seperate class for every webpage
and so in that particular class we used page factory @FindBy annotation to retrieve the element , and we store all the webelements
on that webpage in that class
each page should return the object of its landing page, we also have Utils package in which we were having excel utility , 
Listener ( itest Listner), Screenshot
we have the seperate package for testcases and in that testcases we used assertions of TestNG
