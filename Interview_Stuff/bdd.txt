Data Driven :
we use excel sheet for parameterization
TC and Test Data are stored seperately


BDD : Behavior Driven Development

Feature file: written  in normal english language, test cases are written in it. written 
with the help of  gherkin kyewords

Given: precondition/ URL, Test data
When : Actions / User
And  : Step(we can describe the test        step using and keyword)
Then : Results  

we maintain 5/6 Testcases in a single feature file




Step Defination File:

word step defination means the definations of the steps which we have wrote in feature file 

The steps which we have wrote in feature file we get the business logic or code behind it is written in step defination file.


for n feature files we have n step defination file




runner.java

we execute those steps in this class file


as we have annotations in testng we also have annotations in BDD that are

@Before (we can mention precondition in it)
  and @After ( driver.close())
