What is TEstNG?

= TestNG is an open-source test automation framework for Java. 
--annotations
--execution order of annotations
--prioritise TC
--Grouping TC
--depends on method
--Parameterization ( data driven frameworks , preferable for less inputs)
--Data Provider(Preferable for more number of inputs)
--skipping Test Cases( using enabled=false and skippedexception)
--testng.xml


hard and soft assertion ?

--When an assert fails the test script stops execution unless handled in 
  some form. We call general assert as Hard Assert

Hard Assert –
 Hard Assert throws an AssertException immediately when an assert 
 statement fails and test suite continues with next @Test
 The disadvantage of Hard Assert – It marks method as fail if assert 
 condition gets failed and the remaining statements inside the method will be aborted.
 To overcome this we need to use Soft Assert. Let’s see what is Soft Assert.

 
Soft Assert – Soft Assert collects errors during @Test. Soft Assert does not 
 throw an exception when an assert fails and would continue with the next step
 after the assert statement.If there is any exception and you want to throw it
 then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement in the @Test and 
 test suite again continue with next @Test as it is.

-- Severioty and priority

Bug Severity or Defect Severity in testing is a degree of impact a bug or a Defect has
 on the software application under test.
